## Description

The "Ping Pong Ball Java Project" is a simple Java-based implementation of the classic Ping Pong game. The project utilizes Java's Swing library to create a graphical user interface for the game. Players control paddles on either side of the screen to bounce a ball back and forth. The goal is to prevent the ball from crossing their side of the screen while attempting to make the ball pass the opponent's paddle to score points.

## Technology

Project is built with:

  * Java version 17.0.2
  * Visual Studio Code Version: 1.76.0
